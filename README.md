Simple Python API wrapper for [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

City Data
---------
City data is from [cities.json](https://github.com/lutangar/cities.json), and has been edited to remove irrelevant data.

Requirements
------------
Install requirements by running:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) is required.

Notes
-----
- Some WeatherAPI API implementations have not been tested, due to time constraints. These need to be tested:
  - [ ] Search and Autocomplete API
  - [ ] IP lookup API
  - [ ] History API
  - [ ] Sports API

- UI is incomplete
